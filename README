Rotator_Controller derives from the K3NG rotator controller code.

The changes include
--- Developed for Teensy 3 and 4 series microcontroller
--- Version for HCO_board with relays and 7 segment
--- Version with BigFont to make it more like the GreenHeron controller
--- Lots of changes to better suit my programming style
--- Scratchy pot filter for rotors with grounded wiper
